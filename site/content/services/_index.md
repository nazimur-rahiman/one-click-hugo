    text: >
      Root canal treatment is sometimes called root canal therapy or endodontic
      therapy, and is carried out when the central part of the tooth has become
      damaged and infected. This damage may be due to trauma or might be due to
      untreated tooth decay. When the tooth is damaged it allows bacteria to
      penetrate the inner structures of the tooth, eventually reaching the very
      centre of the tooth which is called the pulp cavity.
