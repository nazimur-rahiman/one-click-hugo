  - heading: Root Canal Treatment -  from painful to painless tooth
    text: >
      Root canal treatment is sometimes called root canal therapy or endodontic
      therapy, and is carried out when the central part of the tooth has become
      damaged and infected. This damage may be due to trauma or might be due to
      untreated tooth decay. When the tooth is damaged it allows bacteria to
      penetrate the inner structures of the tooth, eventually reaching the very
      centre of the tooth which is called the pulp cavity.

       Inlays are restorations from porcelain or composite resin material matching the color of the tooth, and provide almost invisible dental restoration while repairing the chewing surface. Dental inlays are generally more durable than regular fillings.
      An onlay is a method used to repair a tooth that has more extensive damage
      affecting a greater surface of the tooth
